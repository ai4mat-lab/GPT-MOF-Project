# GPT-MOF-Project
In this project we used GPT-4o-mini engine to extract key elements from scientific literature regarding metal-organic frameworks features and their CO2 capture properties.

Using the algorithm_pseudocode.md file, you can write your own code to extract MOF data from literature.

MOF_database_cleaned.csv contains the csv output of data extracted from 434 articles. The data has been cleaned and is machine-readable.
