# GPT-MOF-Project
In this project we used GPT 4O mini model to extract insights from scientific literature regarding metal-organic frameworks and their CO2 capture properties.

Using the algorithm_pseudocode.md file, you can write your own code to extract MOF data from litarture.

MOF_database_cleaned.csv contains the csv output of data extracted from 434 articles. The data has been cleaned and is machine readable.
